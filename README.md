# guitar_shack_legacy_java

"Legacy code" version of the Guitar Shack implementation for folk to practice on

I refuctored my Java solution for the Guitar Shack exercise into a Big Ball of Mud with hardwired external dependencies
that make unit testing currently impossible.

There are, of course, no automated tests. But there's a Program.main() method you can run with 2 arguments to process a
sale: product ID (int) and quantity sold (int).

The program will check stock and sales data from two AWS web services to decide if an alert needs to be sent to reorder
new stock.

The Guitar Shack owner wants to change the logic of how we calculate the reorder level for a product. Currently it uses
the rate of sales during the previous 30 days.

It must now calculate the rate of sales during the NEXT 30 days, but in the /previous/ year. e.g., if today's date is
Dec 24th 2020, the rate of sales will be calculated for sales of that product which happened during Dec 25th 2019 - Jan
24th 2020.

To make this change safely, you're going to need to add fast-running tests. To add fast-running tests you're going to
have to separate some of the concerns in the Big Ball of Mud.

Once you've got some fast-running tests around it, make the change the customer requested. Then, while you're in there,
apply the "Boy Scout Rule" and clean up the code a bit more to make life easier for the next person who has to work on
it.

Happy refactoring!

## Some information on my refactorings

- Software does not generate any value on itself - it needs to solve a problem, so it's considered valuable. I try to
  put the domain of the problem first.
- I try to keep things simple/pragmatic and only use a java interfaces if there is more then one implementation.
- Many coding tasks consists of three general parts: read data, transform/calculate the data, write/notify the
  transformed data back somewhere and I usually try to isolate those parts for the following reasons:
    - The "read data" part is usually has "external" dependencies and requires more effort on testing while local "
      transform data" phase is mostly easier to test
    - By keeping those phases isolated, the test combinations will be as small as possible
- Use plain immutable values objects between "reads" and "calculates" so they can be easier tested, exchanged in future
  etc.
- I have a convention on suffix to reveal consequences on the name already
    - repository, notifier or poster (not used in this kata) will reach out to an external source
    - converter or calculator will perform a simple transformation without any external calls
    - service will wire things up and is mostly the entry-point
